  Introduction
</h1>

    <p>
Jessica struggled with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093?mc_id=google&campaign=288473321&geo=9007795&kw=%2Bepilepsy&ad=250593970211&network=g&sitetarget=&adgroup=21357633401&extension=&target=kwd-20276573816&matchtype=b&device=c&account=1733789621&invsrc=neuro&placementsite=enterprise&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1NzZBRCoARIsAIaMwut1bovMhXr0jNXQ3E6aVNFKNUDSniGiaWQAXqVbfYf4V9NftrZCYkUaAgtaEALw_wcB"> epilepsy</a> her entire life going through countless different medications to control it. She was a very kind and caring person who always put others before herself, and even when she was sick, it was still more about the other person rather than her. She was admitted to Mercy Medical Center back in August of 2016 for low blood counts which caused her to suffer from massive fatigue. This diagnosis then led us on a journey to discover the actual cause of what was creating these issues. After<a href="https://mdmercy.com/"> Mercy Medical Center</a> we went to <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>,<a href="https://www.jhu.edu/"> Johns Hopkins</a>, then all the way to Houston Texas to<a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/"> MD Anderson</a>. Jessica had blood transfusions almost every day because her blood counts would keep plummeting from the disease. After going through several rounds of chemo both at Johns Hopkins and MD Anderson, it seemed that the disease had finally won and she was given only a week to live. After this news, we rushed her back from MD Anderson to Johns Hopkins then back home for the remainder of the time she had left. Jessica was the kindest and most caring person I have ever met, and I will miss her always.

    <h1>
      Jessica loved her job at Mercy Medical center
    </h1>
      <p>She was a loved employee with lots of friends from all different departments. When she was sick at the beginning her biggest concern was when am I going to be able to get back to work! She always took pride in her work staying as late as needed to get her job done. This picture shows the plaque that will stay at Mercy in rememberence of her many years of dedication. </p>
