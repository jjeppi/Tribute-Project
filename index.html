  Introduction
</h1>

    <p>
Jessica struggled with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093?mc_id=google&campaign=288473321&geo=9007795&kw=%2Bepilepsy&ad=250593970211&network=g&sitetarget=&adgroup=21357633401&extension=&target=kwd-20276573816&matchtype=b&device=c&account=1733789621&invsrc=neuro&placementsite=enterprise&gclid=Cj0KCQjw1NzZBRCoARIsAIaMwut1bovMhXr0jNXQ3E6aVNFKNUDSniGiaWQAXqVbfYf4V9NftrZCYkUaAgtaEALw_wcB"> epilepsy</a> her entire life going through countless different medications to control it. She was a very kind and caring person who always put others before herself, and even when she was sick, it was still more about the other person rather than her. She was admitted to Mercy Medical Center back in August of 2016 for low blood counts which caused her to suffer from massive fatigue. This diagnosis then led us on a journey to discover the actual cause of what was creating these issues. After<a href="https://mdmercy.com/"> Mercy Medical Center</a> we went to <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>,<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/the_johns_hopkins_hospital/"> Johns Hopkins</a>, then all the way to Houston Texas to<a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/"> MD Anderson</a>. Jessica had blood transfusions almost every day because her blood counts would keep plummeting from the disease. After going through several rounds of chemo both at Johns Hopkins and MD Anderson, it seemed that the disease had finally won and she was given only a week to live. After this news, we rushed her back from MD Anderson to Johns Hopkins then back home for the remainder of the time she had left. Jessica was the kindest and most caring person I have ever met, and I will miss her always.

    <h1>
      Jessica loved her job at Mercy Medical center
    </h1>
      <p>She was a loved employee with lots of friends from all different departments. When she was sick at the beginning her biggest concern was "when am I going to be able to get back to work!" She always took pride in her work staying as late as needed to get her job done. This picture shows the plaque that will stay at Mercy in remembrance of her many years of dedication. </p>

  "A year ago today my beautiful niece Jessica Chesbro Jeppi left this world, entirely too early. Jessie was a beautiful soul, a sweetheart, silly a little goofy sometimes, but always had such a positive outlook. This is the 1st time, I think, that I have spoken about her passing on here. Just couldn't bring myself to actually put it down in writing. I guess it just makes it too real. I can still hear your voice asking me about my health, how I was doing all the while taking your own illness in stride. Jessie was one of a kind and will be missed by so very many people. Heaven is a sweeter place now that you are an occupant. I love and miss you so very much, but you are here, alive in my heart, for as long as I walk this Earth." -Marty Rothstein

  "Two weeks ago when she left us; we will never be the same. Jessica Chesbro Jeppi's innocence, strength, resilience, cheerfulness & unconditional love & forgiveness will be an inspiration for the rest of our lives. This pic is from around Christmas in January or Feb, a couple/few months into the leukemia diagnosis, after the 1st round of chemo had failed. She was so sure she was going to beat this thing. Jess was headed to TX for the clinical trial. We all went to dinner to see her off. She gave me the biggest best hug ever & whispered in my ear 'Dont worry. I'm gonna be OK'. And I lied to her & said 'I know you will baby'. Oh Jessica we miss you SO MUCH." -Jonathan Mayo
